## More experiments

Tomato plant had grown a lot since our last visit (almost double so tall). We decided to experiment only with sound and voice today and leave other stimuli like water or touch. For this we used the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1188976">Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)</a> We carried out 5 experiments:

1. No stimulus
2. 200 Hz - 100 amplitude
3. 200 Hz - 200 amplitude
4. RAVDESS database – actor 7
5. RAVDESS database – actor 8

### Documentation

We documented the following factors:
