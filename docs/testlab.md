## Our Plant

For our tests we used two young tomato plants as shown in the following image. This photo shows the plant at the beginning of our COINs21 seminar in May 2021.

## Our testlab

As testlab we are using an office at the data center of the University of Bamberg which is located at Feldkirchenstra√üe 21. The room is on the first floor on the north side and not used for other purposes. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic the data center is quite empty and the plant is not disturbed a lot by people passing by or working in offices nearby.

Here are some information about the enviornment of our testlab:

- The window is directed to the north side and the plant is not affected by direct sunlight.
- The plant is damped and thus protected from soil vibrations.
- Nobody except of our group has access to the room and the plant has no other human contact as well as no contact to animals.
- The plants gets watered when needed around three to four times a week.
- Because of the lack of sunlight we move the plant to an window in another office with some other plants on the southside.
- All electric devices including the powerplugs in the room are turned off, especially during the experiments. The only electric devices we use are the laptop (not plugged in) and if needed a speaker.
- While we are running the tests, nobody is in the room and the doors are closed. The room is covered by a firedoor which isolate very good from disturbing noises.
- The windows have a quite good isolation from street noises. However, some noise remains audible.

Here is a photo of the lab from the 19.06.2021:
