title: Plants as biosensors
---

**Welcome to our platform!**

This platform is created in the context of the Collaborative Innovation Networks seminar [COINs2021](https://sites.google.com/view/coinseminar21/home).

The potential of plants as biosensors has been researched by Peter A. Gloor and others for the last couple of years. As plants are very sensitive and perceive already slight changes in their environment, they appear to have a huge potential to track human behavior and emotions. The Mimosa Pudica for example was able to predict whether people passing the plant were happy or sad, and even was able to differentiate between several persons walking by. Thus, it is imaginable that one day plants will be able to replace current sensors like smartwatches etc.
(For more information see Gloor (2021) Groupflow: How Measuring Happiness and Groupflow with AI creates People and High Performing Organizations, and Gloor and Oezkaya (2020) Recognizing Individuals and Their Emotions Using Plants as Bio-Sensors through Electro-static Discharge)

To get one step closer to reach that goal, students of the collaborating universities all over the world are conducting experiments and doing research.
This platform is meant to establish a network between the different teams researching on the topic of plants as biosensors. Relevant literature, directions on how to use hardware, and any other helpful information can be shared and accessed through this platform.
