## Our testlab

As testlab we are using a office at the datacenter of the University of Bamberg which is located at Feldkirchenstra√üe 21. The room is on the first floor to the north side and not used for other purposes, and cause of the Covid-19 pandemic the data center is quite empty and the plant is not disturbed a lot by people passing by or working in neighbour offices.

Here are some information about the enviornment of our testlab:

- The window is to the northside and the plant is not effected by direct sunlight.
- The plant is damped and thus protected from soil vibrations.
- Nobody except of our group has access to the room and the plant has no other human contact as no contact to animals.
- The plants gets watered when needed around three to four times a week.
- Cause of the lack of sunlight we move the plant to an window in another office with some other plants on the southside.
- All electric devices including the powerplugs in the room are turned off especially during the experiments. Only the laptop unpluged and if needed a speaker remains active.
- While a test is performing nobody is in the room and the doors are closed. The room is covered by a firedoors which isolate very good from disturbing noises.
- The windows have a good isolation from street noises.

Here is a photo of the lab from the 19.06.2021:

## First tests

On our first test we tried to get a understanding of the Spikerbox and we tried to see the biggest impacts on our plants.

In the following experiment we saw strong impacts on the Spikerbox:

- Impact on light like a flashlight of an mobile phone.
- Impact  on watering the plant.
- Impact on touching. The plant is not reacting to all materials which touch the plant. Plastic shows almost no reaction the touch of a hand much more.
