## First tests

On our first test we tried to gain an understanding of how to use the Spikerbox and we tried to see what stimuli had the biggest impacts on our plants.

In the following experiment we saw strong impacts in the signal measured with the SpikerBox:

- Impact on light like a flashlight of a mobile phone.
- Impact  on watering the plant.
- Impact on touching. It seems like the material also plays a role.
