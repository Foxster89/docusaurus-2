## Testlab

As testlab we are using a office at the datacenter of the University of Bamberg. The room is not used for other purposes and cause of the Covid-19 pandemic the data center is quite empty and the plant is not disturbed a lot.

The window is to the north side and the plant is not effected by direct sunlight.

the plant is damped and thus protected from soil vibrations

## First Test

On our first test we tried to get a understanding of the Spikerbox and we tried to see the biggest impacts on our plants.

In the following test we saw strong impacts on the Spikerbox.

- Impact on light like a flashlight of an mobile phone
- Impact  on watering 
- Impact on touching. The plant is not reacting to all touches. Mostly to touches with the hands and not with plastic.
