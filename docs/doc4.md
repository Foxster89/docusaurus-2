## First tests

On our first test we tried to get a understanding of the Spikerbox and we tried to see the biggest impacts on our plants.

In the following experiment we saw strong impacts on the Spikerbox:

- Impact on light like a flashlight of an mobile phone.
- Impact  on watering the plant.
- Impact on touching. The plant is not reacting to all materials which touch the plant. Plastic shows almost no reaction the touch of a hand much more.
