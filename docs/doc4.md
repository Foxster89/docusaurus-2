## Testlab

As testlab we are using a office at the datacenter of the University of Bamberg. The room is not used for other purposes and cause of the Covid-19 pandemic the data center is quite empty and the plant is not disturbed a lot.

- The window is to the northside and the plant is not effected by direct sunlight.
- The plant is damped and thus protected from soil vibrations.
- Nobody except of our group has access to the room and the plant has almost no contact.
- Plant gets watered when needed around three times a week and has no other direct stimuli or contact.
- All electric devices including the power in the room are turned off especially during the experiments.
- While a test is performing nobody is in the room and the room is covered by a firedoors which isolate very good from outside noises


Here is a photo of the lab from the 19.06.2021:

## First Test

On our first test we tried to get a understanding of the Spikerbox and we tried to see the biggest impacts on our plants.

In the following test we saw strong impacts on the Spikerbox.

- Impact on light like a flashlight of an mobile phone
- Impact  on watering 
- Impact on touching. The plant is not reacting to all touches. Mostly to touches with the hands and not with plastic.
