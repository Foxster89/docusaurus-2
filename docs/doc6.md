### Tests

First we wanted to get a new baseline to see how the plant is doing without any stimulation. On test Nr.06 the cable fall off and on test 07 we recoginsed that the powerplug which is closer to the plant was not turned off. We could not say if this had any impact so we did a third test without any stimululation. On test 08 we still discovered much higher activity then we discovered on the test from the 04.06.

Test 09 was with the childrens choire 1Voice. The test 10 and 11 took place two days later on the 21.06 to give the plant some time to recover.
On test 10 we did again a test without any stimulation but with similar results like before on the 19.06.
