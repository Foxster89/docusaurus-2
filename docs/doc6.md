### Tests

First we wanted to get a new baseline to see how the plant is doing without any stimulation. On test Nr.06 the cable fall off and on test 07 we recognized that the powerplug which is closer to the plant was not turned off. We cannot rule out that this  distorted our recording, so we did a third test without any stimululation. On test 08 we still discovered much higher activity then we discovered on the test from the 04.06.

Test 09 was conducted with songs of the One Voice Children's Choir. The tests 10 and 11 took place two days later on the 21.06 to give the plant some time to recover.
On test 10 we tested without any stimulation again, but obtained similar results like on the 19.06.
